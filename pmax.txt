### `pmax`
#### April D. Makukhov
The 'p' in pmax stands for 'parallel'. This function outputs the parallel maxima of values inputed. Essentially, this means you can take one or more vectors and, with pmax, create a single vector that has only the maxima between the multiple vectors. pmax allows you to find the maximum values among multiple vectors and receive an output with those maximum values.
```{r}
# Making 2 vectors, x and y, of the same length
x <- c(1,5,7,9,3,15,37,128,4)
y <- c(2,8,12,54,207,95,73,122,62)
pmax(x,y) # this gives a single output vector that contains the maximum values of these two vectors with respect to position. For example, the first value of the pmax vector is 2 because '2' in the first position of vector y is greater than '1' in the first position of vector x.
```
