### `^`
#### April D. Makukhov

This symbol is an operator used in mathematics to symbolize an exponent. It can be used on numeric or complex vectors or objects labeled as a numeric value.

```{r}
10^2 # This calculates 10 to the 2nd power

x=3
y <- x^5 # Here were are setting y to be represented as x to the 5th power, using the ^ symbol to set 5 as the exponential value
print(y)

cat=12
dog=3
cat^dog # we can do this with characters as well as long as those characters are represented by a numeric value
```
