### `list`
#### April D. Makukhov
This function is used to create a list in R, which can be made up of numeric values or even variable names.

```{r}
y<-list(1,2,3,4)
y

x<-list('apple','orange','strawberry','kiwi')
x

z<- c(x,y) # here is an example where I am combining the 2 lists I made above into one vector

z

# list is also a useful function for plotting. In this example below, we are using data that is already in R (car data), and creating a vector z that is making a list made up of components 'x' and 'y', and each of those components is equal to a column of data from the cars dataset.

z <-list(x=cars[,1], y=cars[,2]) # making a list with 2 components, x and y, where x is comprised of the cars data in column 1 of the dataset, and y is comprised of the cars data in column 2 of the dataset

z
 
plot(z) # after creating this vector z, we can see the 2 components of the list, z$x and z$y, plotted against each other
```
